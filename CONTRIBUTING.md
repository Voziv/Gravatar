# Contributing to lrobert\Gravatar

We welcome your contributions. There are a few ways you can contribute.
- [Submitting](https://github.com/lrobert/Gravatar/issues) bug issues or suggesting improvements
- [Subbmiting Pull Requests](https://github.com/lrobert/Gravatar/pulls).

## Some Guidelines
- **Be brief, but be bold**: State your issues briefly, but speak out your ideas loudly, even if you can't or don't know how to implement it right away. The world will be better with limitless innovations.
- **Code in PSR**: We use PHP Standards Recommendation (PSR) from as the PHP Framework Interoperability Group (PHP-FIG). If you're not familiar with this standard, please [familiarize yourself now](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards). Use [PHPCodeSniffer](http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer/) to check your code against this standard.
- **PHP Doc**: In addition to coding in PSR we use PHP Doc on classes, methods, and properties. For inline comments remember that when writing documentation it's important to say Why something is being done, not how.
- **Test your code**: Nobody else knows your code better than you. So, please, test your own code before submitting your pull request. lrobert\Gravatar uses [PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de/) as our testing framework.
- **Request pull in separate branch**: Do not submit your request to the master branch, but create a separate branch named specifically for the issue that you addressed. Read [GitHub manual](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) to find out more about this. If you are new to GitHub, read [this short manual](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) to get you familiar with forks and how git works in general.

That's it. Thank you for your interest in lrobert\Gravatar, and welcome!
